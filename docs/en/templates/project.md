# Project Templates


`prismctl project init` creates project-level workflow directories and a Gemini project memory file:

- `.prismctl/plan/` for plans
- `.gemini/GEMINI.md` (managed block)

Project templates are meant to make the "team workflow on disk" explicit and version-controllable.

See: `../projects/project-init.md`.
