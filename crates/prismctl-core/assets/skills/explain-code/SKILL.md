description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies
---

When explaining code, always include:

1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life
2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens
4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?

Keep explanations conversational.
