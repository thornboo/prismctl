# Prismctl Plan Directory

This directory stores task plan documents generated/maintained by Prismctl workflows, so work is reproducible and archivable.

- `current/`: active task plans (recommended: `<task>.md`)
- `history/`: archived plans for completed tasks (recommended to move from `current/`, optionally with a timestamp)

Notes:
- Prismctl built-in workflow templates (Codex/Claude) reference this directory layout.
- If you don't use Prismctl workflows, you can delete the entire `.prismctl/` directory.
